h2. WHAT

A small gem to do what I need.

h2. TEST

Edit spec/database.yml and run rake spec.

Test data is recreated automatically when running rake spec.

h2. IDEAS

* find a better Hash patch format
** move the key outside the diff Hash ?
* support removed records ? (I don't need that for the moment)
